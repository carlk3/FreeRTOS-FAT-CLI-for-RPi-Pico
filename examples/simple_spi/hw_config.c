There should be one element of the spi[] array for each RP2040 hardware SPI used.

There should be one element of the spi_ifs[] array for each SPI interface object.
* Each element of spi_ifs[] must point to an spi_t instance with member "spi".

There should be one element of the sdio_ifs[] array for each SDIO interface object.

There should be one element of the sd_cards[] array for each SD card slot.
* Each element of sd_cards[] must point to its interface with spi_if_p or sdio_if_p.
